Here my scholars marvel at the massive amount of unmarked graves of New York slaves who were close in age to them. We discussed the stark difference how one group was honored in their death and another group were buried in unmarked graves and left to be forgotten. The power of bringing the classroom alive was felt today with my students.\n",

      "Last Saturday we had an incredible time visiting the African Burial Ground National Monument and Museum, a national park in Lower Manhattan. In 1991 human skeletal remains were discovered when construction began on a federal building on 290 Broadway. This chance uncover led to the unearthing of the America’s first and biggest African burial ground. This cemetery was used from roughly the mid 1630s until 1795 and contains the remains of an estimated 15,000 plus enslaved and free Africans, who played integral roles in New York’s development. Hundreds of years ago the African community in New York buried their dead to not only honor, mourn, and celebrate them, but also actively resist American efforts to objectify their bodies and souls. Indeed, these activists recognized humanizing themselves was an act of defiance. After the remains were found, Black Americans fought that same fight to honor those buried. Because of their concerted efforts, 420 of the deceased were required and the monument was established. We are grateful for the generous staff at the African Burial Ground for reminding us that resistance is not singular in form or limited in timing. Just fighting for recognition of one’s own humanity is a brave act of defiance, and one to be celebrated. @nationalparkservice #africanburialground #africanburialgroundnationalmonument\n",

      "The African Burial Ground National Monument, located in Lower Manhattan, memorializes an estimated 20,000 free and enslaved Africans who were buried on the 6.6-acre plot from the 1690s until 1794. The burial ground was rediscovered due to the construction of a Federal Office Building in 1991. An archaeological excavation followed after rediscovery. In 2003, the skeletal remains of 419 enslaved and free Africans were reinterred within the Burial Ground. New York's African population was restricted from burial in Trinity Church. The City allowed New York's African population to bury the deceased beyond the city commons in a area of land considered desolate and unappropriated. Later identified as the African Burial Ground, the site became the most significant African-administered institution in New York City. It honored African burial traditions amidst harsh legal regulation until its closure in 1794. As development pressures began to overtake Lower Manhattan during the nineteenth century, the burial ground was covered and forgotten until its rediscovery. A memorial designed by Rodney Léon, AARRIS Architects, and Elizabeth Kennedy Landscape Architects was opened in 2007. Oriented to true north and east, the monument is centrally-located with three major elements – the Ancestral Chamber, Circle of the Diaspora, and sunken Libation Court. On the north, native shadblow trees, significant as an early food source, frame the view of the monument from the Ted Weiss Federal Courthouse Building. Reminiscent of the interments, seven symbolic earthen mounds housing the 419 skeletal remains were created in front of the shadblow trees. Honey locust trees were introduced as a backdrop, while the landscape was subtly laid out to maximize site interpretation. In 1993, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The memorial was proclaimed a National Monument in 2006.⁠\n",

      "I spent the evening rummaging through old hard drives and came across the first image from a trip to #nyc in 2015. Rereading the plaque at the #africanburialgroundnationalmonument led me to rereading about the so-called #NegroFrontier in early #colonial New Amsterdam at modern-day #washingtonsquarepark and the long #historyofslavery in New York (see Wikipedia entry). This then led me to the speech by Rev. Nathaniel Paul on July 5 (today), 1827, the day after slavery was abolished in #newyork . His introductory words, now just shy of 200 years old, remain all too relevant: “We look forward with pleasing anticipation to that period, when it shall no longer be said that in a land of freemen there are men in bondage, but when this foul stain will be entirely erased, and this, worst of evils, will be forever done way. The progress of emancipation, though slow, is nevertheless certain: It is certain, because that God who has made of one blood all nations of men, and who is said to be no respecter of persons, has so decreed; I therefore have no hesitation in declaring this sacred place, that not only throughout the United States of America, but throughout every part of the habitable world where slavery exists, it will be abolished.”\n",

Both sites are black history other than civil war, civil rights, or a portion of a larger multi-dynamic historic site. Nicodemus National Historic Site is the only remaining all black settlement west of the Mississippi that was part of westward expansion (which I know is problematic in its own right). It is off the beaten path in Kansas and was consider the “promise land” of freedom for its black community members. My second site is the opposite of off the beaten path. African Burial Ground National Monument is a must visit if you are in NYC. It is a powerful site. It tells the story of both free and enslaved African Americans during the formation of New York.

      "This book was recommended in a session I attended at #NCTE18 on how we can promote social issues while also studying nonfiction. I learned a lot about the institution of slavery in the Northern US, during colonial times, and more. I really enjoyed this and have been able to find a few more places to visit like the African Burial Ground National Monument in NY and the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana. I definitely recommend this as a late middle school read for students learning about archaeology and how it informs our knowledge about slavery, since some of our textbooks don’t quite give us the entire picture.\n",

Its main bldg is the Ted Weiss Federal Bldg at 290 Broadway.The site contains the remains of more than 419 #africans buried during the late 17th and 18th centuries in a portion of what was the largest colonial-era cemetery for people of #africandescent, some free, most enslaved. Historians estimate there may have been as many as 10,000[6]–20,000 burials in what was called the #NegroesBurialGround in the 1700s. The five to six acre site's excavation and study was called \"the most important historic urban archaeological project in the #unitedstates .\"The Burial Ground site is #newyork ‘s earliest known African-American #cemetery; studies show an estimated 15,000 #africanamerican people were buried here. 😲\n",

      "(6/15/2010) From the 1690s until the 1790s, thousands of captive and freed Africans were buried at this Site in today’s Lower Manhattan in New York City. Burial of Africans was not allowed within the city walls of the Dutch city New Amsterdam (later New York City); as many as 15,000 bodies were interred at the Site. Closed in 1794 and buried under 200-years of urban growth, the grounds were rediscovered in 1991 during the construction of a federal office building. Ancestral remains of 419 individuals were ceremonially reinterred at the Site in 2003. In 2007, a granite Memorial was dedicated.\n",

A very informative video, tons of photographs, interactive exhibits, and artifacts that were found when exhuming the 419 bodies found here. It’s estimated that more than 15,000 slaves buried loved ones here. Unfortunately, the outside monument was closed for renovations. We are planning to come back again to see perhaps in the summer.

      "On day 6 of Black History Month, we're celebrating Peggy King Jorde, one of those behind-the-scenes catalysts who never gets the glory but is the real person who gets things done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jorde was instrumental in converting the old Audubon Ballroom, the Harlem site where Malcolm X was fatally shot in 1965, into a memorial center. She's now consulting on a documentary about an environmentalist's fight to save a massive African burial ground on St. Helena Island, a British protectorate in the South Atlantic.\n",
      "But probably her most well-known effort was going up against varied political interests in New York City to push for the creation of the African Burial Ground National Monument near City Hall and Wall Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jorde is a native of Albany, Ga., and the daughter of a civil rights lawyer who, as a student, drove Booker T. Washington's buggy around Tuskegee Institute. Her father's work led to integration of Albany schools in 1964.\n",
      "Jorde studied architecture at Columbia and was a planner in the office of construction for Mayor David Dinkins, New York's one and only black mayor, when she first learned of the burial ground a short walk from City Hall. She began firing off memos to parties in power despite being warned against it. Finally, by '91 and '92, people began listening and word filtered into the black community, who organized vigils at the site. People had been buried at the site according to West African burial rites, Jorde told those in power. They were buried there at a time when slaves made up one-fifth of the population of Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The African Burial Ground National Monument was finally established in 2006. It is the resting place for 15,000 free and enslaved Africans who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries. \"This is something rare,\" Jorde, who lives in New Jersey, told Harvard Magazine. \"Imagine if it had been a dinosaur out there?\n",

      "I attended The African Burial Ground in downtown Manhattan today. It was a powerful experience, a wonderful museum and sacred ground where approximately 15,000 men, women and children are buried. In 1991 the remains of 419 of them were excavated and studied for research. In 2003 they were all ceremonially re-buried in honor through ancestral practices. New York is an important spot in the transatlantic slave trade as millions of slaves were brought through our ports. Let us never forget the horrors of slavery, it's continued and residual impact today and make it our obligation to learn all we can about it. I should have gone a long time ago and that's my own white privilege to turn away. As if it's not my history too. It's all of ours. Slavery IS us.\n",

      "Walking out of my audition Thursday, I opened my umbrella, and stepped out into the hot rain. Looking at my phone for the train, I grumbled about being hot and hungry. I walked down the street, and at a corner, I noticed a sign nearby. I considered walking past, but my feet turned the corner instead, and headed down a side street to the African Burial Ground National Monument. What the hell feet? I'm tired... But my body knew what I needed to see. So I let my feet keep walking.\n",
      "The African Burial Ground National Monument is the largest African burial ground in the Americas. Active through the late 1700's. Over 6 acres, both slaves and free African Americans are buried there. It was found during survey work when the city wanted to build a federal building. The official site states:\n",
      "The Burial Ground’s rediscovery altered the understanding and scholarship surrounding enslavement and its contribution to constructing New York City. The Burial Ground dates from the middle 1630s to 1795. Currently, the Burial Ground is the nation’s earliest and largest African burial ground rediscovered in the United States. An externalmemorial, an interpretive center, and research library were constructed to commemorate the financial and physical contributions of enslaved Africans in colonial New York and honor their memory.\n",
      "A group of students were taking the tour, so I walked through with them... Listening to the guide tell their story, I wasn't hot, or tired anymore. I was... grateful. So, so grateful. I could feel my purpose just vibrating through time and space. OUR purpose... to not have our ancestors die in vain. To remember our history so we don't repeat it. To be eternally thankful for their sacrifice. To tell all that treat us like we are not equal that this nation was built on these brown and black people's backs. And we will never stop fighting for equality. For respect. I will never stop... Go see it. It's inspiring and peaceful. See and remember who we are, and more importantly, who we should never be again. 🙏✊🇺🇸🌍 #africanburialgroundnationalmonument\n",

Only a few blocks from Ground Zero, it’s a haunting reminder that while 9/11 was a more recent if isolated event, our society is *still* dealing with the tragic, far-reaching, and inhumane consequences of the African slave trade. Oppression is a system, not a moment. #nationalmonument #africanburialgroundnationalmonument #blm #historyrepeats #knowyourhistory\n",

      "On this day in 1993, New York City declares an eighteenth century black burial ground in lower Manhattan an historical landmark. The cemetery, which was discovered during construction of a federal office building, contains the remains of over four hundred slaves. The bones were turned over to anthropologists at Howard University for closer study. #SlaveCemetery #HistoricalLandmark #Slaves #Slavery #HowardUniversity #AfricanBurialGroundNationalMonument #NewYorkCity #BlackHistory #BlackHistoryMonth\n",

      "The African Burial Ground National Monument located in NYC displays photos of remains excavated from the “Negroes Burial Ground\" in use during late 1600s-1700s. The burial ground once contained roughly 15,000 slave-era souls that were paved over by the city’s iconic financial district. In fact New York had the 2nd largest population of slaves in the US next to Charleston. As cemetery tourists, we often fall into the unfortunate trap of promoting history of existing grave sites at the expense of neglecting stories of those whose tombstones are no longer visible due to urban expansion and disrepair (or those that were never marked at all). On the whole, historically black cemeteries receive astonishingly less conservation funding and are deteriorating at an alarming rate. You can help by making an effort to research and conserve historically black cemeteries in your area. During this month of remembrance and every month it’s important to preserve the legacy of African American grave sites in the United States before they are lost forever. #africanburialgroundnationalmonument #blackhistoryisamericanhistory #blackdeathsmatter #deathpositive #necropolitics .\n",

      "After visiting the #AfricanBurialGroundNationalMonument, which I recommend everyone should go to if you're in New York, I went to St. Paul's Chapel which is the oldest surviving church building in Manhattan. I walked in side and I happened upon the choir rehearsing and visitors could sit and listen. After walking almost 2 miles around the city I needed to sit down and rest. This was my reward for not having a plan or destination today. I set out to wander the city and I received the most beautiful treat. #saltywoman #cfirl #cfaware #cysticfibrosis #cureCF #cffoundation #breatheeasy #stpaulschapel #nyc #nycdotgram\n",

      "In 1991 a burial ground was unearthed when construction began on a new federal building. If it weren’t for the organized protests in the black community, I don’t think the government would have even stopped construction. The fact that there were slaves in New York as late as 1827 is not something most people, including me, ever learned. When I was doing my research, I found that a lot of the imagery of African Americans, especially before there was photography, was very stereotypical, racist, and offensive. I wanted to focus on images of labor because I think people aren’t aware of the contributions that African Americans made to the building of colonial NYC. They were not only manual laborers, but also blacksmiths, printers, doctors, and teachers. A tragic byproduct of slavery was that people were totally cut off from the past. One of the reasons the Burial Ground project was so emotionally charged was that it had to do with discovering one’s ancestors, and reestablishing a connection with a lost past.\n",

      "In the 1690s until 1794, both free and enslaved Africans were buried in a 6.6-acre burial ground in Lower Manhattan, outside the boundaries of the settlement of New Amsterdam, later known as New York. Lost to history due to landfill and development, the grounds were rediscovered in 1991 as a consequence of the planned construction of a Federal office building.\n",

      "Soooo, I decided today to spend my lunch across the street from work at the #AfricanBurialGroundNationalmonument #NYC. •In #1991 during the construction of the #TedWeiss #FederalBuilding, in #NY 419 human skeletal remains were exhumed. In #1993 a small portion of the original 6.6 acre cemetery became the 1st below-ground #NewYorkCity #Landmark and a #National #Historic Landmark. This burial ground was #proclaimed on #February 27th #2006.• If you have never been to see this, Make it apart of your #NewYork attraction. Inside the building they show a short movie abt this as well. And its #Free99. ** I took a picture (mid left pic) of #Burial22 -> 22 is my Lucky Power number and the day of my Birth. Buried in that spot it states was a \"Child between two and a half and four and a half years old\" whats interesting is on either sides were #Burial135 \"A man btwn 30 and 40 yrs old\" and #Burial328 \"A woman btwn 40 and 50 yrs old\"...
